# Podcast Popularity Prediction 

There are different notebooks for stages of the model building pipeline such as: feature extraction (pretrained, traditional), evaluation (traditional, proposed), experimentations and data acquisition.

The original data source from which we curated features is by Yang et al: https://github.com/ylongqi/podcast-data-modeling.

Pre-trained dmodels are imported directly from Tensorflow Hub.

Code is executed on Google Colab environment with limited GPU.

You will need Python, Tensorflow, Librosa, PyDub and Audiomentations packages.
